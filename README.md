# Keep the Pubs busy
A tool designed to create a dynamic menu that will adjust the price of beer to keep pubs busy throughout the week
<br />
### Requirements:
- The more beer in the keg, the cheaper it should be. Supply and demand 101
- Friday and Saturday are already busy, hike up the price to make people go during the week instead
- The busier the pub, the more pricey the beers should be. By reducing the number of people inside will let the bar staff have a breather
